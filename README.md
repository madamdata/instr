Dependencies : zexy pdlua cyclone ggee moonlib iemguts iemlib maxlib - go to 'find externals' in the menu, find these libraries and install them. You'll need to add -lib zexy to the startup or manually include it in the startup libraries to lead (preferences -> startup) for zexy to work idk why it's like that pd is a mess haha
